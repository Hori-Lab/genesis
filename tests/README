GENESIS Regression Tests
=====================================

Regression tests are prepared for ATDYN, SPDYN and prst_setup
(parallel I/O) to check if these programs work correctly.

In order to run the tests, execute a Python script
(regression_test/test.py) in the following way:

  $ cd regression_test/
  $ ./test.py [genesis command] [parallel_io (optional)]

Here, [genesis command] is a command line for executing genesis
simulators (either ATDYN or SPDYN). The default is "mpirun -np 8 atdyn". 
[parallel_io] is appended when checking the parallel I/O facility.
Examples are follows:

  # execute spdyn test
  $ ./test.py "mpirun -np 8 /path/to/spdyn"
   
  # execute spdyn, parallel_io test
  $ ./test.py "mpirun -np 8 /path/to/spdyn" parallel_io

Note that the regression tests are designed to be executed with 8 MPI
processes. In particular, the parallel I/O test will be failed with
other MPI conditions. As for ATDYN and SPDYN tests, other MPI
conditions may give invalid results.
